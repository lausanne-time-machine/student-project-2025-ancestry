There are several things we need to evaluate our model on:

1) OCR: is the ocr working as intended? How does the rows in our data match with the census pdfs?
2) Is levenshtein correcly matching the true jobs?
3) Person Tracking: is the person tracking currently tracking persons accurately? How many persons are incorrectly labeled as being the same?
